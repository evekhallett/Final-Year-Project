1. goodman_nt3.py

Extracts the Prot.FCC values and third nucleotides for codons 2-11 from coding sequences, input file is data from Goodman, Church and Kosuri (2013)
Output is goodman_nt3.csv.

2. wilcoxon2-10vs11.R

Calculates mean content of each nucleotide per codon position which is outputted as means.csv. 
Also calculates the mean nucleotide frequencies for codon positions 2-10. 

Performs wilcoxon tests between the mean nucleotide frequencies of codon positions 2-10
vs 11. W statistics are plotted.
